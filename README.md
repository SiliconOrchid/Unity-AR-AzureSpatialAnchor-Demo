## What are we doing?
This source code accompanies a series of blog articles, where weâ€™re work through a  project that demonstrates how to use Augmented Reality (AR) on a mobile device.

Over the course of the series, we're going to review an application that:

* Uses **AR technologies to locate and position** our mobile device within the real world.   
* Gives us tools to **place and reposition 3D "scenery" objects** within the "virtual mirror" world.  
* Has functionality to **save and retrieve** both the real-world "anchor" and a selection of "virtual scenery" objects to the cloud.  

This will allow us to **return to the same physical location** and observe the virtual scenery - either at a later date or using a completely different device.

The demo application will be created using *Unity* with *ARFoundation*, backed by *Azure Functions* and *Azure Spatial Anchors* for cloud-based AR persistence.
